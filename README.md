# networkScanner-Switch
this repo conatains two small projects: one for scan a network and the other to connect to cisco switch over SSH or Telnet and execute three commands
the executable files are built in Linux Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 10, so it might be some errors!

both projects have a simple and nice GUI built with tkinter.
